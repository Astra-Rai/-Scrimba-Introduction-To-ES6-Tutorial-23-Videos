//Includes Method

/*The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false as appropriate. */


let numArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
//check if an array had a value, we'd use indexOf, now we use includes
console.log(numArray.includes(0));//false
console.log(numArray.includes(2));//true
